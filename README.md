 # Objective <a name="objective"></a>
 
I recently discovered in my journey as a budding Data Scientist that Python will be a crucial tool on a day-to-day basis. While several wonderful FREE online sources exist to teach yoou the nuances of a new language, I personally believe tat you'll learn better while doing. Learning anything new can be exhausting, but it need not be boring. 

I've challenged myself to code projects that I find particularly interesting or want simulated! In this process, I would like for this repository to be a space for multiple beginners (or experts) like me, to contribute and help it grow. You would also learn version control this way! BONUS!

Credit goes to Leah Nguyen, whose mini-python-project idea has been a great source of inspiration in my learning journey. [Check her profile out here!](https://github.com/ndleah)
