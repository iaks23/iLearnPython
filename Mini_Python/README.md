# Mini Python 🐍

### Difficulty Level: Intermediate 🤓

Bring back memories from the good old 90s & early 2000s by recreating the infamous SNAKE game for 3 different levels. Your objective is to help this mini python grow bigger in size with every bite of the apple it takes (it's a vegetarian python) without letting it crash into itself!

# Concepts Covered 📖
 * Loops
 * Conditionals
 * List Manipulations
 * Pygame Modules

# Dependencies ⚙️

You will require Pygame to ensure the smoth running of the game. On your terminal window, assuming [Pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/) is installed, run the following command:

```python
pip install pygame
```
> 💎 tip: you can also do this using Jupyter notebook!

# Customization 👗

Pygame allows for a lot of customizatioon options including [shapes](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/draw.html) and [colors](https://www.webucator.com/article/python-color-constants-module/). You need not necessarily stick to the default ones I've chosen!

# Implementation 💻

Run the following command on your Windows Command Prompt/MAC OS Terminal

```python
python minipython.py
```
